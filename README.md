# [DeadlineBook](https://github.com/deanmiranda/DeadLineBook) Tips and Tricks

>**Note**: This is a starter code repo to develop a React app that uses, MongoDb, GraphQl, and Express in order to demonstrate modern Full-Stack Developer practices.<BR>

# Basics

## Requirements

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Use a polished UI.
* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
* Use React for the front end.
* Include authentication (JWT).

## Additional Requirements

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
* Include a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used,
* screenshot, and link to deployed application).
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards.
* Look professional and be mobile-friendly.


## Bonus
* Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform into your project.
* If you donâ€™t create an e-commerce application, you could use
* Stripe to set up your site to accept charitable donations.

## Getting Started

![Install MongoDb for your OS](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
Set up a DB in Mongo and confirm its path matches line ~13 in server.js file.
1. npm i
2. cd into client folder and run "npx create-react-app deadlinebook" to build your React FE. After success, run "npm start", leave this terminal open to run the React app, it will open in a browser tab if properly configured.
3. Go back to the root of your directory, and run server.js to set up your local server. Run "npm run start" to set up the server.
4. View site in localhost port.
